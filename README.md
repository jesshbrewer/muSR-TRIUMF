muSR-TRIUMF
===========

muSR (Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance) data display & analysis software at TRIUMF


This repository is meant to (eventually) contain the sources (mostly FORTRAN) of tools developed for storage, manipulation, display and analysis (e.g. fitting to models) of muSR data on Linux systems at TRIUMF.  See http://musr.ca for details and online examples.  See http://musr.org for an overview of muSR.  The fitting software is not standalone; it assumes access to the CERN libraries including MINUIT.
